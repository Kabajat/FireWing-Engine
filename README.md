## How to use?

First you need to clone the git repo and open it.

### Setting up the application name and source directory
If you're on Windows open the ``build.bat`` file.

```bat
set APPLICATION_NAME=<your application name>
set GAME_DIR=<your application source directories>
```

The second variable is for the source files for your application.

You can change these two to your specific needs.
